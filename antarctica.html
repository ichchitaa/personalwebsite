							<h2>A walk through Antarctica</h2>
                            <p>Before I ever visited Antarctica, my perception of it was the same as everyone else’s - that it is just endless miles of plain, unadulterated snow. 
                            But it is so much more. I went to Antarctica when I was 14 and it is - by FAR - my favorite place on Earth. </p>
                            <h3>Background info:</h3>
                            <p>My family chose Quark Expeditions to go to Antarctica with. This is one of the few expeditions that goes to Antarctica from Chile instead of Argentina - and we wanted this because the Chilean Antarctic base (where we would enter the continent) has an airplane runway, so there is a choice to fly there, instead of sailing across the Drake passage. </p>
                            <p>We went in December 2016 (summer in Antarctica) and the cruise lasted 6 days. </p>
                        
                            <h3>Places we visited (sailing through the Lemaire Channel):</h3>
                            <!-- <p>We sailed through the Lemaire Channel! The places we visited were:</p> -->
                            <li>King George Island</li>
                            <li>Portal Point</li>
                            <li>Orne Harbour</li>
                            <li>Port Lockroy</li>
                            <li>Deception Island</li>
                            <p> </p>

                            <h3>Rules we had to follow:</h3>
                            <li>Not feeding the animals</li>
                            <li>Covering up holes we made in the snow (because tiny penguins can fall in them and would have a hard time finding their way out)</li>
                            <li>Not littering anywhere</li>
                            <li>Not going within 6 feet of the penguins, as it tends to scare them</li>
                            <li>Don’t stand in a doorway. The ocean waves in Antarctica are rough at times and this can lead to doors slamming on you.</li>
                            <p> </p>

                            <h3>My reflections on it and why it was my favorite trip ever:</h3>
                            <p>Whenever I go on holiday, I love trying new things and learning as much as I can from seeing and doing new things. What made Antarctica special is that the place itself has such a strong appeal, even before you get into sightseeing over there. My favorite memories in Antarctica can’t be attributed to specific locations or activities. But experiences! Most of them unbelievable, other-worldly experiences that were unlike anything I could have imagined before. </p>
                            <p>There is so much that I saw that I wish I could see again for a first time! Penguins. Icebergs. Glaciers. (Learning the difference). Icebergs melting into the sea. The midnight sun. Miles and miles of pristine nature. Did I mention penguins? </p>
                            <p>OH and so many things I wish I could do again for the first time! Riding a zodiac. Writing a postcard to home from Port Lockroy. Snow trekking. Whale watching. The list goes on!</p>
                            <p>These experiences were a snippet of what made it such an incredble trip, and I realized Antarctica is the closest thing we have left in the world to untouched human nature. It struck me at some point that I was a whole CONTINENT away from any civilization. All in all, it showed me a side of the world I never had fathomed could exist. It is beautifully tucked away, and, in my opinion, a living metaphor of a “hidden gem”. </p>
                            <p>Antarctica is filled with hidden sights and things to do that are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face - in the moment, and also when you reflect on them years later (and while writing a blog post about it!). I truly understood how the little things - the things that may not initially constitute to much - can have so much significance and bring you so much joy. </p>
                            <p>And finally, the people that I met on the cruise are ones that I keep in touch with to this day. The connection that was formed by exploring the most wonderful part of the world with them has prevailed over time, even though I spent just 6 quick days with them.</p>
                            <p>So from the polar water to watching penguins run around, from wearing parkas to sporting rubber boots and from seeing the midnight sun to snow trekking for the first time. I love love love Antarctica - all the way to the South Pole and back.</p>
