							<h2>Being a third culture kid in the modern world</h2>
                            <p>It’s confusing. It’s amazing. It’s scary.</p>
                            <p>A third culture kid is someone that has spent a significant portion of their childhood outside of their parents’ culture, and that grew up as an expat. For example, my parents are from India, but I spent most of my childhood as an expat in Oman (and also lived in Bahrain for a few years), so I’m a third culture kid! Yipee.</p>
                            <h3>Pros:</h3>
                            <h4>1. You meet people from a lot of cultures growing up</h4>
                            <p>It’s truly a melting pot of cultures. I was exposed to a myriad of cultures growing up, and the takeaways all got distilled into one unique being: me.</p>
                            <h4>2. You can speak multiple languages</h4>
                            <p>If you live in a country for a long time, in all likelihood you might pick up the local language there. Personally, I went to international schools throughout my life so I didn’t pick up the local language but there are a variety of languages I know some words in - and that has come in handy in more places than I ever expected!</p>
                            <h4>3. You are adaptable to change</h4>
                            <p>So so adaptable. Moving countries or houses or schools - that all becomes second nature. Having a nomadic style of life growing up made me flexible to changes in location and people, and gave me valuable skills with fitting in a new place and interacting with new people.</p>
                            <h4>4. You will easily be able to connect with people, no matter where you go</h4>
                            <p>The people skills given by a third culture kid upbringing are extremely valuable. Furthermore, I found when I moved to university that I was able to find common ground with people from lots of different places! It is truly special to be able to do this, and I absolutely love connecting with people this way.</p>
                            <h3>Cons:</h3>
                            <h4>1. There’s no simple way to explain where you’re from</h4>
                            <p>Like really. Every time someone asks me this, I get a mini identity crisis. I try to give a short explanation but it turns into a (sliiiiightly) condensed summary of my life.</p>
                            <h4>2. “Home” might not be attached to a specific geographical location</h4>
                            <p>I’ve heard other people toss around the term “home” indifferently, and for the 
                                longest time this confused me. Because what exactly was it? Which of the multiple 
                                places in my life am I really from? Surely all of them could be justified as 
                                “home”? E.g. I may not have grown up there but my extended family lives there. 
                                Or my family isn’t from there but I did grow up there. The rant goes on, but you 
                                get the idea. </p>
                            <p>Despite the cons, I LOVE being a third culture kid. It hasn’t been without its share of obstacles and confusions. But it is SO worth it. The diversity, exposure and global identity you get is a truly unique experience.</p>
