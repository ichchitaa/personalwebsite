							<h2>Skydiving: Is it life-changing?</h2>
                            <p>Jumping out of an airplane would kill you, right? Right? Wrong.</p>
                            <p>This is what I was telling myself while I was sitting in the airplane that took us 
                                a staggering 13,000 feet up in the air. From where we would jump...and fall.</p>
                            <p>I went skydiving in Dubai in January 2022. There was a fair amount of trepidation 
                                and nervousness churning inside me as the airplane took me closer to my fate. 
                                The excitement, however, kept me ploughing on. This is something that had been 
                                on my bucket list for years! Aside from my love of thrill, I had heard from a 
                                lot of sources that skydiving is a life-changing experience, and I wanted to find 
                                out for myself if it really was!</p>
                            <p>In the airplane there were about 7 other people plus their instructors. I was sitting 
                                at the very end of the row, so this meant they all went before me. The trepidation 
                                was building up. With every person that I watched fall, fall and fall further, 
                                I became both increasingly nervous and excited. Knowing that each fall was one 
                                closer to me being next. Finally it was my turn. My instructor told me to get ready. 
                                I don’t remember jumping - I just remember 
                                starting to fall, cold wind rushing in my face, and my instructor tapping my 
                                shoulder and telling me to smile at the camera. Which was taking a live VIDEO!!</p>
                            <p>And as we fell, it started to become AMAZING. There is nothing like the rush of 
                                falling from the sky and knowing you will make it to the bottom. This sounds just 
                                a tad cheesy, but it really felt like flying. 
                                The views I got were by far the most stunning views of Dubai EVER!!</p>
                            <p>I’ve heard people compare the experience of skydiving to that of being on a 
                                roller coaster. Personally, it felt nothing like that. When on a roller coaster, 
                                there are multiple ups and downs, and you are firmly seated throughout. When 
                                skydiving, on the other hand, you are gliding in the air, harnessed only to your 
                                instructor and a parachute, and the sensations you get are more “floating 
                                and (kinda???) fine” 
                                as opposed to “lurching and uncertain”. </p>
                            <h3>Tips (if you decide to take the plunge!)</h3>
                            <li>Wear something comfortable and warm. I wore sweatpants and a comfortable jacket. It will be windy and 
                                possibly (VERY) cold up there, so make sure you are dressed well for that!</li>
                            <li>Close your mouth when you’re in free fall! If you don’t, cold wind will fly at 
                                blazing speeds into your mouth, possibly making it hard for you to smile at the 
                                camera (yikes). Which will be 
                                taking a video!!! Trust me, I learned this the hard way!</li>
                            <li>Enjoy the experience. There really is nothing like skydiving. So just be there 
                                in the moment, and enjoy your 60 seconds of free fall, followed by 5 minutes of 
                                parachuting where you see stunning views. It you stay actively present 
                                throughout, it could be the best 6 minutes of your life! </li>
                            <br/>
                            <h3>So, was it life-changing? </h3>
                                <p>Well I would certainly say it gave me some life-changing realizations.</p>
                            <p>The most important one was that the world is a lot bigger than you think it is. 
                                From that high up in the air, you can see miles and miles and yards and yards 
                                away from you. I’m someone that occasionally worries at length about little things. 
                                When I was up there and could see so much of the world in just one line of sight, 
                                I realized how inconsequential it is to worry. There’s so many more and better 
                                things in the 
                                world you can redirect your attention to. </p>
                            <p>Another big impact on me was the confidence it gave me. After I landed back on Earth, 
                                I thought to myself “Damn, I just did that!”. And I realized I could do other 
                                things that scare me. Which aren’t NEARLY as scary as jumping out of an airplane. 
                                Few things in the world can give you such an intense confidence boost!</p>
                            <p>So in, conclusion: was it nerve-wracking? Maybe a little. Was it worth it? 10000000 percent YES.</p>
                            <p>After all, it’s always a good day when you jump out of an airplane. And then survive.</p>
